# Chess Tree

This is an ~~infinite~~ **very large** tree, showing every possible chess game.

For performance reasons, the render distance is one turn.

Use WASD to navigate the tree of possiblilities.


You can view the project [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rtavenner/Chess-Tree/master/index.html).


### Coding language

This is coded in Elm 0.18. I could have easily used 0.19 instead, but I haven't gotten around to installing it yet.

index.html is compiler output.

### Code quality

The chess code is not great. *(Why does chess have to be so complicated?)* The hyperbolic plane code is better.
